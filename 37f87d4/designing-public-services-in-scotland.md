This resource is for anyone interested in Scotland's public services â€“ whether you deliver them, use them, or help design them. It outlines the approach that we use (and constantly improve) in the Scottish Government. This will help us work in a consistent way.

You can use it to:

* understand the principles of working in a design-led way, and how this makes public services better
* understand the different stages of the design process, and why it's important to involve citizens and users (of all kinds, not just the people who need the service but also those who deliver it)

This resource is in alpha, so we'll continue to improve it. We'd like you to be part of that improvement.

You can contribute to the development of this resource:

* on the [Scottish Approach to Service Design website](http://designwithscotland.scot)
* by emailing us at [ursd@gov.scot](mailto:ursd@gov.scot?subject=Scottish+approach+to+designing+public+services)

## Going forward

Developing this guide to support the design of public services is a high priority for us and we'll update this as we move forward.

Our [high level roadmap](link to roadmap) outlines our plans.
