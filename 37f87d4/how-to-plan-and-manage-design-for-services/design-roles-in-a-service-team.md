Designing and delivering services requires a multidisciplinary team with a wide range of skills and experience. Your team might include existing staff or you may need to hire new staff or contractors to meet the needs of the project.

The service team are not only people involved in the design and delivery of the service, but they will likely be the core team involved at the design stage.

## Design roles

During 2017 the UK’s Government Digital Service (GDS) led a project resulting in the new Digital, Data and Technology Profession (DDaT) profession being agreed across all UK departments and the devolved administrations &mdash; Scottish Government was fully involved in this process.

There are a number of user centred design roles that are part of the Digital, Data and Technology (DDaT) profession within Scottish Government. DDaT replaces the previous ICT profession and is being introduced to attract and retain the talent needed across this area.

There are 7 job 'families' within DDaT, including the user-centred design job family. The other job families are Product & Delivery; Data; Technical; IT Operations; Security and Testing.

There are 7 roles in the user-centred design job family:
