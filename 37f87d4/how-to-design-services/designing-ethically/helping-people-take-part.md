Make any research and design activities that you organise inclusive and accessible. This will help your attendees feel welcome, appreciated, respected and motivated to take part.
Ask participants what they need that would help them take part. Explain to them what the research will involve and be prepared to make changes that will make it easier for people to participate.

Try not to make assumptions about what people might need.

## Using the inclusion form

You can use the inclusion form to ask people coming to your event about their individual needs.

Download the [Inclusion Form](/assets/images/service-design-guide-images/Inclusion-Form-ACC-EXP.pdf).

Send this form out to attendees before your event, giving yourself enough time to make any arrangements. If you need more information on what they have told you, contact the person and check with them.

Delete any inclusion forms immediately after your event. This is required to meet the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

## Using the venue accessibility checklist

Some people will require additional support in order to participate in research activities. Ensuring that they will be able to access the research venue is a basic requirement.

Download the [Venue Accessibility Checklist](/assets/images/service-design-guide-images/Venue-Accessibility-Checklist.pdf).

Use this form with venues to identify any potential issues. If possible, try to visit venues to double check.

## Including British Sign Language (BSL) users

We have a duty to support people whose first or preferred language is British Sign Language (BSL) to participate in the design of Scotland’s digital public services and policies.
This is in line with the aims set out in the [British Sign Language (BSL): National Plan 2017 to 2023](https://beta.gov.scot/publications/british-sign-language-bsl-national-plan-2017-2023/).

### How to include BSL users

If possible, offer BSL interpretation services to research participants.

English is a second language to a BSL user, so make sure you write any information or instructions in plain English so it's easy to understand.

### How to contact a BSL interpreter

Only use certified interpretation providers. You should book interpreters a minimum of 2 weeks in advance. You can also ask the participant if they have a preferred certified BSL interpreter. Check if your organisation has guidance on using certified BSL/English interpreters and how to book one.

### How many interpreters you may need

One interpreter can sign for between 20 to 30 minutes. This means if you’re doing a 1 hour interview you’ll need 2 interpreters.

Alternatively, you can use 1 interpreter, giving them a 15 minute break after the first 30 minutes. Check with your chosen interpreting service provider for up-to-date information on using interpreters.

### At the venue

Make sure:

* the venue you're using can accommodate the BSL interpreter &mdash; for example, consider where the interpreter would stand while signing
* you can sit facing the BSL user, or if there are multiple attendees that everyone can see each other &mdash; for example, have the room in a horse-shoe or circle layout
* you're at the venue early &mdash; interpreters try to arrive before an appointment so they can greet the BSL user when they arrive

### Contacting participants

You could use the following example text when contacting a research participant.

> “[Our organisation] want to make sure everyone can take part in our events. If you need a BSL interpreter or have other needs please let us know. We may need to share your information with a third party to support your needs. Please let us know if this is ok.
>
> You can contact us on the email address [me@myorganisation.com].”
