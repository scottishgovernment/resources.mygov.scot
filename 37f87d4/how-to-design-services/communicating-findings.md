There are many ways to share research findings with a wider team, organisation, stakeholders or users.

Tools can help you share you findings and help people see, hear and understand what you've found and see the data in new ways.

This section is currently in development and will be available soon. The guidance will include how to:

* develop user needs and stories
* create journey maps and storyboards
* create descriptive personas

This will be regularly updated with new guidance as we develop and test it.

Read guidance from the GDS Service Manual about [sharing research findings](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/user-research/sharing-user-research-findingsâ€‹).
