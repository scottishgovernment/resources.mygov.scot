**_Beta – We are currently reviewing our grid format, with a view to creating fixed padding and gutters which are scaled to the screen size._**  
<br>

## Breakpoints
Defining breakpoints and using a responsive grid allows content to be arranged on the basis of the screen size of the device used to access it, tailoring the experience for users.

We use 4 content breakpoints which relate to the following devices:

* **Mobile** – 320px – 767px
* **Tablet** – 768px – 991px
* **Desktop Medium** – 992px – 1199px
* **Desktop** – 1200px and over

Media queries are used to identify the viewport (screen) size of the device accessing the site and call on the relevant CSS to style the content accordingly. A 6 unit grid is used for mobile and tablet, with an extended 12 unit grid for both of the desktop options. Padding is fixed at 15pxls and gutters are fixed at 30pxls.

The use of 6 and 12 units allows for maximum flexibility when grouping units into columns, easily enabling units to be grouped into full-width columns, half-width columns, thirds and quarters.

## Design Theory
Using a grid to align content results in layouts which are ordered, consistent and simple to navigate by users. Grids also allow efficient layout of content as positioning can be pre-planned and defined, allowing complex sites to be worked on by more than one designer or developer, delivering a uniform structure and journey for users.

<br>

## Usage
There is currently no universally accepted best practice defining the optimum number and position of breakpoints for responsive design. We have opted to set our breakpoints based on analytical data which defined the most common screen sizes used to access our site.

<br>

## Accessibility
Using a grid -based design ensures adequate clear space in content layout and also helps to establish a visual hierarchy which works well with screen-readers and other assistive technology.
