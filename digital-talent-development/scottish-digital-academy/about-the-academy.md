The Scottish Digital Academy was set up in collaboration with GDS Academy.

Its focus is making sure that Scottish public sector organisations have a coherent learning and development programme to:

- develop and grow our in-house capability to build effective digital services
- transform how government delivers services that meet users’ needs

We want to equip our people with digital skills, so they can fill key roles in our projects and programmes.

## Course information

The Scottish Digital Academy currently delivers courses on a monthly basis, but this may change depending on demand.

Anyone working for a public sector organisation in Scotland can apply for these courses.
The length of courses varies, depending on objectives and the level of skills needing to be developed. They range from a one day Discover Digital and Agile course to a 10-day accredited Digital Foundation course.

## Programme outcomes and benefits

The [GDS Academy website](https://www.gov.uk/gdsacademy) outlines the aims and objectives of each course.

The courses introduce new ways of working, focussed on user-centred service design.

Developing these skills contributes to building capability and creating the culture change needed for digital transformation in government.

The courses also have benefits to participants’ organisations, including:

- increased capability to create industry leading services through service centred design
- increased efficiency
- consistency in learning, ways of working and the implementation of Digital Transformation programmes across the public sector
