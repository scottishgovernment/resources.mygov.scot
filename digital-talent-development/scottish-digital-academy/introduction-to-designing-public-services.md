## Course summary
This course has been designed for anyone involved in commissioning or delivering the design or transformation of public services. It will also benefit those interested in learning about new ways of thinking about solving problems.

This course is not intended to turn you into a service designer or user researcher, but it will give you an insight of what a service designer and user researcher does and how they think. It might not make you a Service Designer, but will help you collaborate with them more effectively.

## Course aims and objectives
Service design thinking, methods and tools enable a user-centred approach to designing public services and policy.

This programme introduces the key principles of service design, and intends to begin to build a culture of user-focused thinking into public sector organisations.  
It will raise your awareness and understanding of:
- what service design is, how the design process works and how this fits with agile;
- what user research is? How it is applied throughout the design process? Why it’s fundamental to understanding the behaviours, contexts and needs of our service users? How collaborative user research and design activities should be conducted, in line with the Scottish Approach to Designing Public Services?  

The programme includes a service design challenge – a light touch experience of an end-to-end service design project.

This learning will take place across 3 days, and include:
- a selection of **case studies and practical examples** that illustrate the value of service design and how the methods and tools work in practice
- a **service design challenge** - a challenge will be set and attendees will work through the design phases to explore the problem and design a solution, in collaboration with service users and service providers. This is an opportunity to try out collaborative sense making and co-design, which are fundamentals of the Scottish Approach to Designing Public Services.
- be able to **identify opportunities to involve citizens** in the design of your public services
- have an understanding of the **Scottish Approach to Designing Public Services** – the key principles of collaboration and inclusivity that underpin this, and how these are applied in practice
The Service Design Champions Programme brings together people involved in the design and delivery of public services and policy to learn strategic design approaches, and become champions of the service design approach within their organisation.
