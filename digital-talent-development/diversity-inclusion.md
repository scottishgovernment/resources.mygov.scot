A more diverse workforce can deliver benefits for organisations and citizens by helping teams innovate and create solutions that meet the needs of everyone living in our communities..

We will not fully deliver an inclusive and accessible digital Scotland unless we continue to strive for a diverse digital workforce.

To address the digital skills gap in Scottish Government and across the public sector we are encouraging applications from a larger pool of potential applicants to help us build the skills we need for the future.

Scottish Government has signed the Tech Talent Charter, which is a public commitment to increasing diversity in the DDaT profession.

## Improving recruitment practices

We are taking action to remove barriers that prevent under-represented groups progressing into and within the profession. We are also taking action to promote digital role models from diverse backgrounds.

These efforts are designed to attract digital talent and make sure the public sector is seen as a desirable place to work due to the level of ambition and opportunity to improve outcomes for people who rely on essential services.

## Improving gender balance

Positive action will aim to increase the number of applications from women for digital jobs. We already have gender-mixed recruitment panels at both sift and interview stages.

The DDaT profession will bring people into government from all backgrounds and provide career progression across a broader range of job roles. This will ensure there are career opportunities for everyone to progress and flourish in their roles.

## Improving the perception of working in digital

We will promote digital as an attractive career choice for young people, women, disabled people, veterans and minority ethnic people. Itâ€™s often said that digital is a team sport and we need people with a variety of life experiences and backgrounds to make sure we have the skills and experience we need for success.
