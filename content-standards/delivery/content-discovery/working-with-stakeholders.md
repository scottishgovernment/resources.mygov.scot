## What it is
Stakeholders can include organisations, people and services, though ultimately you have to communicate with people.
You need to make sure any content you design is endorsed by the organisation, service or department you are designing with. Creating an effective relationship with stakeholders smooths the content design process and ensures the 'fact check' or 'sign off' stage of your publication workflow runs smoothly.
You should have a clear vision of who your stakeholders are at all times during the content lifecycle.

## Why it’s important
Stakeholders are especially important during the discovery and publication stage - work with them to:
* validate theories
* test content
* align against business objectives

Working with the correct stakeholders ensures you are creating and designing content that is a business requirement.
The presence and opinion of engaged stakeholders (especially subject matter experts) is vital when trying to ensure live content is kept factually accurate and fit for purpose.

## How you do it
Carry out stakeholder mapping – who does this affect and what influence do they have?
1.	identify and approach stakeholder(s)
2.	determine their influence, availability and interest
3.	establish stakeholder map and communications plan

Once you have your stakeholder map, identify the following roles (the same people may cover multiple roles):
* content owners
* fact checkers
* subject matter experts

Throughout the project you must continue to influence and engage stakeholders at appropriate points dictated via your content plan and product or content workflow.

You'll need to:
* plan and lead workshops – to explain what you’re doing, why, what you’re asking people to do and what the benefits of your project will be.
* create consistent and clear communications for stakeholders
* show and tell stakeholders what you are doing, via workshops, meetings, emails, calls, show and tells or staging sites

Try to always be honest and transparent in your approach.

Roles and responsibilities of typical stakeholders:

### Sponsor
The final sign off and escalation point for content. It’s recommended that this is a member of a senior management team.

### Content Designer
The individuals responsible for the content creation process from discovery through to publishing. They’re responsible for incorporating changes from peers and subject matter experts.

### Subject matter expert (SME)
Subject matter experts are ideally frontline staff who provide direct support to service users, e.g. call handlers or advisors. They have first-hand knowledge of customer pain points, queries and success stories. This first-hand expertise is critical in helping design a good user experience. They are responsible for alerting content designers to any major policy or service changes that might affect content. Their expertise will be critical in helping design a seamless user experience.

### Fact checker
Fact checkers make sure content is accurate and up to date, as well as provide information on where gaps exist. They don’t need to be service users day to day but are responsible for understanding legislative frameworks and policies for your organisation. They’re not expected to write content but provide guidance, source relevant documents and review content and user journeys.

### Legal advisors
Similar to fact checkers, though they check the information against law and legal guidelines.

### Project sponsor
This is the Senior Responsible Officer (SRO). The final sign off and escalation point for the project. It’s recommended that this is a member of the organisation’s senior management team.

### Single point of contact (SPOC)
This individual is responsible for co-ordinating or project managing the activity for the project. Requests should be triaged through this contact, which avoids duplication or communication issues.

### Content owner
The content owner should provide relevant policy information and have ultimate responsibility for the accuracy of content going forward.

Once content is live the content owner has a duty to the user to make sure it’s accurate and up to date. This means regular checks, particularly when there are legislation or policy changes.
