Recruiting the right people to plan, deliver and manage your content.

## What it is

The Digital, Data and Technology (DDaT) profession framework is a list of the specialist roles needed to help government transform the way it works to deliver better services to users.

The framework helps make good decisions on who should be in delivery teams and what they do.

Content roles are part of DDaT, which is currently being introduced to the Scottish Government.

These include:

* Content design roles
* Content strategist
