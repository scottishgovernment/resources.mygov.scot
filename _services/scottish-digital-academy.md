The Scottish Digital Academy was set up in collaboration with [GDS Academy](https://www.gov.uk/gdsacademy).

Its focus is making sure that Scottish public sector organisations have a coherent learning and development programme to:

* develop and grow our in-house capability to build effective digital services
* transform how government delivers services that meet users’ needs

We want to equip our people with digital skills, so they can fill key roles in our projects and programmes.

The Scottish Digital Academy delivers the courses in January, March, and September of each year. But this may change depending on demand.

<br>
## Who can apply for the courses?
Anyone working for a public sector organisation in Scotland.

## How long does it take?
Courses vary, depending on objectives and the level of skills needing to be developed. They range from a one day Discover Digital and Agile course to a 10 day accredited Digital Foundation course.

## What are the outcomes of the programmes?
The [GDS Academy website](https://www.gov.uk/gdsacademy) outlines the aims and objectives of each course.

The courses introduce new ways of working, focussed on user-centred service design.

Developing these skills contributes to building capability and creating the culture change needed for digital transformation in government.

## What are the benefits to our organisation?
* increased capability to create industry leading services through service centred design
* increased efficiency
* consistency in learning, ways of working and the implementation of Digital Transformation programmes across the public sector
